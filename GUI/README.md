Prototype for GUI Testing Application for EsurgiBiotech

Goal: Automate testing process of Biostabilizer by providing a user-friendly interface that is less cluttered and can provide helpful procedures

Current issue: Using an excel spreadsheet that is extremely cluttered. Offers non-linear troubleshooting (For example, if there is an issue with Step 1, QA engineer must scroll down to the index of Step 1 in the "Potential fixes" section.

Design Plan:
1. Create "registration form" esque application.
2. Input user information to identify current QA tester.
3. Start testing --> Does device pass this step? Yes/No
4. If answer is yes, move to next step.
5. If answer is no, provide various trouble shooting tips.
6. If answer is still no, move on.
7. If answer is yes, move on.
8. By the end of the application, all user responses should be recorded in a csv/xlsl file to be held on record.
